## Python Calculator

**Inspiration:**

This Python calculator is inspired by the project available at [https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects/blob/main/projects/Calculator/main.py](https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects/blob/main/projects/Calculator/main.py). 

**Purpose:**

This Python script provides a versatile calculator that can perform various mathematical operations, including:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Average calculation
* Factorial calculation
* Complex number arithmetic
* Binomial coefficient calculation

**Usage:**

1. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. **Choose an operation:** The script will prompt you to select an operation by entering a number corresponding to the desired function.
3. **Input values:** Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the necessary numbers for the chosen operation.
4. **View results:** The calculated result will be displayed.
5. **Continue or quit:** You can repeat the process for different calculations or quit the program by entering "quit."

**Functions:**

* **`addition()`:** Adds a series of numbers.
* **`subtraction()`:** Subtracts a series of numbers.
* **`multiplication()`:** Multiplies a series of numbers.
* **`division()`:** Divides a series of numbers, handling division by zero.
* **`average()`:** Calculates the average of a series of numbers.
* **`factorial()`:** Calculates the factorial of a number.
* **`complex_calculator()`:** Performs complex number arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
* **`binomial()`:** Calculates the binomial coefficient.

**Additional Notes:**

* The script uses the `statistics` and `math` modules for specific calculations.
* The script provides clear prompts and error messages to guide the user.
* The script includes a main loop to allow for multiple calculations.
* A brief pause is added at the beginning to enhance user experience.

This calculator offers a convenient and user-friendly interface for performing various mathematical operations.
